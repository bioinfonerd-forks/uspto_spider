**uspto_spider** 
============================================================

*It is a small python spider to help you collect patent information from uspto.*

----------
Advantages:
---------
1.	Python 3.5: I am using python 3.5 to develop this spider. As [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is still not fully supported for python 3.5 for now. If you want to do some crawling with python 3.5, you should try this out.
2.	Highly-open: You can choose your key word to start the search
3.	Easy-to-go: All you need to do is typing in the keyword you want to search on the [uspto](http://www.uspto.gov/) website and the program will automatically download information about all the patents under your search keywords. Those information includes: patent name, patent code, patent owner, patent region, patent description, link of the full pdf file of this specific patent. 


 



Remarks:
---------
1. You are free to use this spider on your own responsibility.
2. The data base is huge, you can slightly change the program to get your own data
3. Your help is more than welcomed
